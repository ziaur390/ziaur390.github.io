I'm a passionate and self-driven Computer Science student with a strong focus on MLOps, currently pursuing my degree at Pak-Austria Fachhochschule, Haripur. My journey into MLOps started through curiosity and project-based learning — now it's a full-blown passion.

I specialize in automating ML workflows, containerizing applications, and deploying models with real-world DevOps tools like Docker, GitHub Actions, MLflow, and Azure. My work is driven by the goal to build scalable, production-ready machine learning solutions.
